Welcome To Learning Point 

Our Mission: Learning & Sharing Knowledge for positive global contribution.
As learners, we share what we learn via our own created content or reshare others that are available as public domain, and hope you enjoy the contents too and like, share and subscribe if you have not subscribed.

Our platform is focused on learning Turkish language and sharing it, while gradually we will be sharing more topics eHBTo (education, Business, Health, Tourism, Tech and Others like Auto, Real Estate, Martial arts and Artificial Intelligence and beyond).

Our aim targets the non-Turkish who want to learn Turkish or improve Turkish in both English and Turkish language.

We thank the creditors; original content creators, as well as the Products and Services Tools (PAS Tools), such as @ChatGPT, @Claude, @Gemini, @DeepSeek, @Kimi, and so on as well as platforms including the social network platforms; @TikTok, @YouTube, @Facebook and so on.

Our Beloved And Last Messenger of Allaah, Prophet Muhammad Peace Be Upon Him) said "He who does not thank people does not thank Allaah." (Authentic Hadith by Abu Dawud & Albani)

That does not mean we agree with all content that is shared or what they offer, we thank them for what we use and what matches with Ethical & Halal compliance (eHC) fully or at least part of it. Yet we thank all creditors.

Let us learn now and grow knowledge. By listening, liking, sharing and subscribing if you have not.
